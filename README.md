MEAN Stack as registration service

## About this stack
This is was part of my first experiments with node, I consider most of the codebase crappy by now.  
I didn't know much about dependency management at that time, so the angular app dependencies are included as a file rather then another npm/bower project.  
  
The principal function of this platform is to offer a registration service. Once registered, users can update their profiles and post pictures of their work. The admins can use the admin panel to view all profiles and recieve updates periodically.  
### This was fully achieved in under 2 weeks  
while I was doing my finals...

### This platform served as registration service for the Tsunami Art Show  
and was produced for FREE.
